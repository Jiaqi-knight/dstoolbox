% TODO: Discuss the inadequacy of Kirchhoff model for our flatplate airfoil.

\section{LSB}

It can be seen from the PIV measurements that a laminar separation bubble (LSB) forms on the leadind edge of the modified flat plate for angles of attack between $\alpha=$ and $\alpha=$. One can then ask what is the pertinence of defining $f(\alpha)$ attributing a unique boundary layer separation point to each angle of attack. Indeed, in the case of a LSB, the boundary layer is separated at some early location but reattaches downstream. If the early separation point is retained as $f$, the resulting lift will not be the same as if the boundary layer does not reattach later. 


\section{Static model}
The Kirchhoff model is inapplicable to the modified flat plate airfoil, most likely due to the presence of the laminar separation bubble. Indeed, we observe a sudden drop in lift when the separation bubble disappears that cannot be represented by Kirchhoff model. As a result, the ratio between the separated and attached $C_N$ is clearly not represented well by $0.25(1+\sqrt{f})^2$, as shown in Figure \ref{â€¢}.
