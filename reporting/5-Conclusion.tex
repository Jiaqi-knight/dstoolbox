\subsubsection{Switching model}

All models up to now were based on a superposition of different components to normal force. It is therefore interesting to look at the performances of a model based on a switching between submodels. The switch would be triggered by the attainment of the stall and reattachment criterion.

\subsubsection{Static characteristics}

Kirchhoff model is not able to capture the bump in the pre-stall regime due to the presence of the laminar separation bubble.
It would be interesting to look at the static lift curve at different Reynolds numbers. A model taking into account the laminar separation bubble effect could be developed.
