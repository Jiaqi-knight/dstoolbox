	abstract = {Results of a comparison of dynamic stall onset are presented, as assessed from low Mach number windtunnel data contained in the University of Glasgow's database and that from the well established Beddoes' model. The model, which was originally developed to reconstruct higher Mach number dynamic stall characteristics, exhibited a lower stall onset incidence than that assessed from the windtunnel data. The differences and speculations on the physical reasoning underlying the two assessments are discussed. An addition to the Beddoes model is proposed which yields an improved reconstruction of the Glasgow windtunnel data.},

	abstract = {Representative applications are described which illustrate the extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as "piston theory." Based on a physical model originally proposed by Hayes and Lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings has been systematically developed by Landahl, utilizing expansions in powers of the thickness ratio 8 and the inverse of the flight Mach Number M. When contributions of orders delta/M{\textasciicircum}3 and delta/M{\textasciicircum}2 are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's motion. The computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion. Essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bendingtorsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section airfoils at high Mach Numbers. These agree well with results of more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made. Moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence of thickness and profile shape as M grows larger, a discovery that would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic tools. The complexity of more practical flutter analyses—e.g., on three-dimensional wings and panels—is shown to be substantially reduced by piston theory. An iterative procedure is outlined, by which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the successive introduction of higher-order terms in delta and 1/M.},

	abstract = {The present study is focused on modeling of dynamic stall behavior of a pitching airfoil. The deep stall regime is in particular considered. A model is proposed, which has a low implementation and computational complexity but yet is able to deal with different types of dynamic stall conditions, including those characterized by multiple vortex shedding at the airfoil leading edge. The proposed model is appraised against an extensive data set of experimental (alpha, CL) curves for NACA0012. The results of an existing widely used model, having comparable complexity, are also shown for comparison. The proposed model is able to well reproduce not only the classic curves of deep dynamic stall but also the curves characterized by lift oscillations at high angles of attack due to the shedding of multiple vortices. Furthermore, the model appears to be robust to variations of its parameters from the optimal values and of the airfoil geometry. Finally, the model is successfully implemented in a commercial CFD software and applied to the simulation of a vertical axis wind turbine within the actuator cylinder approach. The accuracy of the prediction of the turbine power coefficient in the whole rotation cycle is very good for the optimal working condition of the turbine, for which the model parameters were calibrated. Fairly good accuracy is also obtained in significantly different working conditions without any further calibration.},

The underlying modeling philosophy was that it should be based on the best understanding, or description, of the associated physical phenomena. Even though the model was guided by the flow physics, it requires significant empirical inputs in the form of measured coefficients and constants. Beddoes provided these for a Mach number range of 0.3–0.8. This paper considers one such input for a Mach number of 0.12, where, from the Glasgow data, it is shown that the current stall-onset criterion, and subsequent adjustments, yield problematic results. A new stall criterion is proposed and developed in the best traditions of the model. It is shown to be very capable of reconstructing the Glasgow’s data for stall onset both the ramp-up and oscillatory tests.},

The formation of the primary dynamic stall vortex was identiﬁed as the growth of a recirculation region and the ensuing instability of the associated shear layer. The stall development can be subdivided into two stages of primary and secondary instability with the latter being the effective vortex formation stage. The characteristic time scales associated with the primary instability stage revealed an overall decrease in dynamic stall delay with increasing effective unsteadiness of the pitching airfoil. The vortex formation stage was found to be largely unaffected by variations of the airfoil’s dynamics.},

Comprehensive investigations and tests are performed by varying many ﬂow parameters. The occurring physical 5 characteristics for each case are discussed and evaluated in the present studies. The improved model is also tested on four different airfoils with different relative thicknesses. The validation against measurement data demonstrates that the improved model is able to reproduce the dynamic polar accurately without airfoil speciﬁc parameter calibration for each investigated ﬂow condition and airfoil. This can deliver further beneﬁt to industrial applications where experimental/reference data for calibrating the model is not always available.},

	abstract = {The flow over an oscillating OA209 airfoil under
dynamic stall conditions was investigated by means
of unsteady surface pressure measurements and timeresolved
particle image velocimetry. The characteristic
features of the unsteady flow field were identified and
analysed utilising different coherent structure identification
methods. An Eulerian and a Lagrangian procedure
were adopted to locate the axes of vortices and the edges
of Lagrangian coherent structures, respectively. The
complementary information obtained by these methods
provided deeper insight into the spatiotemporal evolution
of vortical structures within a single dynamic
stall life cycle. In particular, the physical mechanisms
heralding the formation of the primary dynamic stall
vortex were identified as the emergence and subsequent
roll up of a shear layer at the interface between the free
stream and the reversing flow near the airfoils surface.
Accordingly, the stall development was subdivided into
two parts: a primary instability stage followed by a
secondary instability or vortex formation stage. The
characteristic time scales associated with the first stage
revealed an overall decrease of the dynamic stall delay
with increasing unsteadiness. The delay attributed to the
vortex formation stage was observed to be unaffected
by variations in the airfoils dynamics. The combination
of time-resolved imaging and extensive coherent structure
analysis was shown to provide a new approach to
different aspects of dynamic stall.},

We extend recent results on 2D (wall to wall) flat plates pitching from 0° to 90°, to rectangular and elliptical (Zimmerman planform) plates of aspect ratio 2. Surveying a range of pivot point locations and pitch rates, we compare the development of leading edge vortices, tip vortices and trailing edge vortices, with trends in lift coefficient and drag coefficient history. The lift peak is seen to correlate with the maximum size of the leading edge vortex, prior to its shedding and downstream convection. Tip vortices evolve more slowly than leading edge vortices, in the sense that a tip vortex remains coherent and nearly attached to the wingtip until well past leading edge vortex saturation and shedding. Peak lift is delayed to progressively higher angles of attack as the reduced frequency is increased. And the non-circulatory or apparent-mass forces are evidently additive to the circulatory aerodynamic forces, implying applicability of linear superposition.},

The Reynolds number has no discernible effects on the relation between the Strouhal number and the angle of attack in the range = 10°-90° with fully separated flow. As the plate incidence is gradually reducing in this range, the modified Strouhal number based on the effective plate width normal to the freestream is found to remain at a nearly constant level until the bevel angle is taken into effect, which causes a shift of the separation point from the front edge to the rear edge, resulting in a jump of the modified Strouhal number to another higher level of approximately constant value. Accordingly, by the use of a correction factor to account for the effect of bevel angle, a universal Strouhal number of 0.160 + 0.003 can be obtained for c{\textasciitilde}= 10" 90c, It is observed that at low angles of attack e = 0" 5:, the influence of Reynolds number becomes significant due to the occurrence of flow reattachment and is rather complex for plates with different bevel angles. It is also observed that the effect of blockage on Strouhal number measurements can be corrected by employing a simple correction formula.},

	abstract = {We develop a frame-invariant theory of material spike formation during ﬂow separation over a no-slip boundary in two-dimensional ﬂows with arbitrary time dependence. Based on the exact curvature evolution of near-wall material lines, our theory identiﬁes both ﬁxed and moving ﬂow separation, is effective also over short time intervals, and admits a rigorous instantaneous limit. As a byproduct, we derive explicit formulae for the evolution of material line curvature and the curvature rate for general compressible ﬂows. The material backbone that we identify acts ﬁrst as the precursor and later as the centrepiece of unsteady Lagrangian ﬂow separation. We also discover a previously undetected spiking point where the backbone of separation connects to the boundary, and derive wall-based analytical formulae for its location. Finally, our theory explains the perception of off-wall separation in unsteady ﬂows and provides conditions under which such a perception is justiﬁed. We illustrate our results on several analytical and experimental ﬂows.},
