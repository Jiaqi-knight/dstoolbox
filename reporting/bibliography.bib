	abstract = {Results of a comparison of dynamic stall onset are presented, as assessed from low Mach number windtunnel data contained in the University of Glasgow's database and that from the well established Beddoes' model. The model, which was originally developed to reconstruct higher Mach number dynamic stall characteristics, exhibited a lower stall onset incidence than that assessed from the windtunnel data. The differences and speculations on the physical reasoning underlying the two assessments are discussed. An addition to the Beddoes model is proposed which yields an improved reconstruction of the Glasgow windtunnel data.},

	abstract = {The present study is focused on modeling of dynamic stall behavior of a pitching airfoil. The deep stall regime is in particular considered. A model is proposed, which has a low implementation and computational complexity but yet is able to deal with different types of dynamic stall conditions, including those characterized by multiple vortex shedding at the airfoil leading edge. The proposed model is appraised against an extensive data set of experimental (alpha, {CL}) curves for {NACA}0012. The results of an existing widely used model, having comparable complexity, are also shown for comparison. The proposed model is able to well reproduce not only the classic curves of deep dynamic stall but also the curves characterized by lift oscillations at high angles of attack due to the shedding of multiple vortices. Furthermore, the model appears to be robust to variations of its parameters from the optimal values and of the airfoil geometry. Finally, the model is successfully implemented in a commercial {CFD} software and applied to the simulation of a vertical axis wind turbine within the actuator cylinder approach. The accuracy of the prediction of the turbine power coefficient in the whole rotation cycle is very good for the optimal working condition of the turbine, for which the model parameters were calibrated. Fairly good accuracy is also obtained in significantly different working conditions without any further calibration.},

	abstract = {The Beddoes/Leishman dynamic-stall model has become one of the most popular for the provision of unsteady aerofoil data embedded in much larger codes. The underlying modeling philosophy was that it should be based on the best understanding, or description, of the associated physical phenomena. Even though the model was guided by the flow physics, it requires significant empirical inputs in the form of measured coefficients and constants. Beddoes provided these for a Mach number range of 0.3–0.8. This paper considers one such input for a Mach number of 0.12, where, from the Glasgow data, it is shown that the current stall-onset criterion, and subsequent adjustments, yield problematic results. A new stall criterion is proposed and developed in the best traditions of the model. It is shown to be very capable of reconstructing the Glasgow’s data for stall onset both the ramp-up and oscillatory tests.},

Following up on previous work on the onset of dynamic stall (Mulleners and Raffel in Exp Fluids 52(3):779–793, 2012), we combined time-resolved imaging with an extensive coherent structure analysis to study various aspects of stall development. The formation of the primary dynamic stall vortex was identiﬁed as the growth of a recirculation region and the ensuing instability of the associated shear layer. The stall development can be subdivided into two stages of primary and secondary instability with the latter being the effective vortex formation stage. The characteristic time scales associated with the primary instability stage revealed an overall decrease in dynamic stall delay with increasing effective unsteadiness of the pitching airfoil. The vortex formation stage was found to be largely unaffected by variations of the airfoil’s dynamics.},

In the present paper, a new second order dynamic stall model is developed with the main aim to model the higher harmonics of the vortex shedding while retaining its robustness for various ﬂow conditions and airfoils. Comprehensive investigations and tests are performed by varying many ﬂow parameters. The occurring physical 5 characteristics for each case are discussed and evaluated in the present studies. The improved model is also tested on four different airfoils with different relative thicknesses. The validation against measurement data demonstrates that the improved model is able to reproduce the dynamic polar accurately without airfoil speciﬁc parameter calibration for each investigated ﬂow condition and airfoil. This can deliver further beneﬁt to industrial applications where experimental/reference data for calibrating the model is not always available.},

	isbn = {978-1-5108-5476-5},
	abstract = {The flow over an oscillating {OA}209 airfoil under
dynamic stall conditions was investigated by means
of unsteady surface pressure measurements and timeresolved
particle image velocimetry. The characteristic
features of the unsteady flow field were identified and
analysed utilising different coherent structure identification
methods. An Eulerian and a Lagrangian procedure
were adopted to locate the axes of vortices and the edges
of Lagrangian coherent structures, respectively. The
complementary information obtained by these methods
provided deeper insight into the spatiotemporal evolution
of vortical structures within a single dynamic
stall life cycle. In particular, the physical mechanisms
heralding the formation of the primary dynamic stall
vortex were identified as the emergence and subsequent
roll up of a shear layer at the interface between the free
stream and the reversing flow near the airfoils surface.
Accordingly, the stall development was subdivided into
two parts: a primary instability stage followed by a
secondary instability or vortex formation stage. The
characteristic time scales associated with the first stage
revealed an overall decrease of the dynamic stall delay
with increasing unsteadiness. The delay attributed to the
vortex formation stage was observed to be unaffected
by variations in the airfoils dynamics. The combination
of time-resolved imaging and extensive coherent structure
analysis was shown to provide a new approach to
different aspects of dynamic stall.},
